 # Phonebook App

- Console application that stores contacts and allows users to create,
read, update, delete contacts from a SQL Server database.

## Running the application

Ensure you create an `appsettings.development.json` with the required settings.
The application is configured to use Google's Gmail Email server, so a valid
Gmail account is required. If your account uses 2-factor authentication,
you will have to create a
[Google App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en)
and use that password in `appsettings.development.json`.

## Features

- Allows users to create, read, update, delete contacts from the console.

- Users can send an email to one of the saved contacts. -->
